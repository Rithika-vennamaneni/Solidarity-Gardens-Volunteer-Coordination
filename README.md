## Solidarity-Gardens-Volunteer-Coordination

#Phase 1: Research & Planning (Weeks 1-2)Step 1: Understand Your Current System

Interview current volunteer coordinators at the 16 gardens
Document how volunteers are currently recruited and assigned
Identify pain points (e.g., mismatched skills, high dropout rates, scheduling conflicts)
Survey current volunteers about their experience and what would improve retention

#Step 2: Define Requirements

List all volunteer roles needed across gardens (e.g., planting, irrigation, administration, teaching, carpentry)
Identify key skills for each role (physical ability, gardening knowledge, technical skills, time availability)
Determine what information you need from volunteers (skills, interests, location, availability, transportation)
Define matching criteria (skill fit, location proximity, schedule compatibility, interest alignment)

#Step 3: Set Success Metrics
Current volunteer retention rate vs. target
Time saved in manual matching
Volunteer satisfaction scores
Garden coverage/fulfillment rate
